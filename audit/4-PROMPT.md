# AISdb-Lite: Engineering Blueprint & Refactoring Plan Prompt

> **Prompt Version**: 1.1.0
> **Target Report**: 4-REPORT.md
> **Analysis Type**: Engineering Plan for High-Performance PostgreSQL-Only AIS Pipeline
> **Last Updated**: December 2025

### Version History
- **1.1.0** (2025-12-11): Added "Self-Hosted Infrastructure Philosophy" section prohibiting external/cloud services. All storage, database, and processing must be self-contained on local infrastructure.
- **1.0.0** (2025-12-10): Initial prompt version

---

## Overview

This prompt orchestrates the creation of a comprehensive engineering blueprint for refactoring AISdb-lite into a **high-performance, PostgreSQL-only AIS data pipeline**. The analysis uses Reports 0, 1, and 2 as primary input and coordinates multiple specialized agents to produce an actionable implementation plan.

**Core Transformation Goals:**
1. PostgreSQL as the ONLY database backend (remove SQLite entirely)
2. Headless backend (remove ALL visualization)
3. Rust for performance-critical paths
4. Python for flexibility and rapid development
5. Single fixed machine deployment optimization

---

## Report Writing Guidelines

### No Page Limit
- **There is NO page limit** for the report
- Document every architectural decision with full justification
- Include complete code examples, diagrams, and SQL schemas
- Comprehensive coverage is essential for implementation

### Avoid Duplications
- One section per major topic - no repeated analysis
- Cross-reference related sections: "See Section X.X"
- Reference bug IDs from 1-REPORT.md and decision IDs from 2-REPORT.md
- Consolidate related recommendations into single coherent sections

### Reduce Verbosity
- Lead with the decision/recommendation, then justify
- Use tables for comparisons (current vs target, Rust vs Python, etc.)
- Keep code examples focused on the pattern being illustrated
- Distinguish ACTUAL code from ILLUSTRATIVE examples
- No filler: "In this section we will examine..." - just present findings

### Traceability Requirements
Every recommendation MUST include:

```
REQUIRED FOR EACH COMPONENT/DECISION:
├── Section ID: Part.Section (e.g., 1.1, 4.3)
├── Location: affected file path(s) from repository root
├── Current State: what exists now (with line numbers if applicable)
├── Target State: what it should become
├── Justification: why this change is necessary (with metrics if possible)
├── Dependencies: what must be done first
├── Verification: how to confirm the change is correct
└── Related: links to 0-REPORT, 1-REPORT, 2-REPORT sections

EXAMPLE:
### 1.2 SQLite Database Abstraction Removal

**Files:**
- `aisdb_lib/src/db.rs:27-66` (sqlite_prepare_dynamic_insertion)
- `aisdb_lib/src/db.rs:217-251` (insert_dynamic_sqlite)

**Current State:** Dual database support with ~600 lines of SQLite-specific Rust code

**Target State:** PostgreSQL-only with zero SQLite references

**Justification:**
- SQLite cannot handle concurrent reads/writes (single-writer lock)
- No spatial indexing (full table scans for geo queries)
- Code duplication doubles maintenance burden

**Dependencies:** None (first pruning step)

**Verification:**
```bash
rg -n "sqlite|rusqlite" --type rust . && echo "FAIL" || echo "PASS"
```

**Related:** 1-REPORT SQL-001, 2-REPORT Section 8.4
```

### ASCII Diagrams Requirements
The report MUST include comprehensive ASCII diagrams:

1. **Target System Architecture** - Main components in Rust and Python with interactions
2. **Data Flow Diagram** - AIS ingestion through post-processing
3. **Database Schema Diagram** - Tables, relationships, partitioning layout
4. **Before/After Comparison** - Current vs target architecture
5. **Rust-Python Interface Diagram** - PyO3 boundaries and data transformations

Use box-drawing characters (┌ ─ ┐ │ └ ┴ ┘ ├ ┼ ┤) for clear diagrams.

```
DEPLOYMENT TARGET: Single Fixed Machine

Assumptions:
- CPU: 8-16 cores (modern x86_64)
- RAM: 32-64 GB
- Storage: Dual array (NVMe RAID for hot data, SATA RAID for cold/archive)
- Network: Gigabit Ethernet
- OS: Linux (Pop!_OS/Ubuntu-based)

NOT designing for:
- Kubernetes/container orchestration
- Multi-node clusters
- Cloud-specific services (RDS, BigQuery, etc.)
- Horizontal scaling

Optimization focus:
- Maximum single-machine throughput
- Efficient resource utilization
- Minimal operational complexity
- Best possible performance on this hardware
```

---

### Cost Analysis Requirements

```
WHEN DISCUSSING STORAGE/COSTS:

DO NOT:
- Reference cloud pricing ($/GB/month)
- Compare against AWS/Azure/GCP costs
- Suggest tiered cloud storage strategies
- Recommend any external recurring costs

DO:
- Analyze storage efficiency (compression ratios)
- Compare raw vs compressed sizes
- Calculate local disk utilization
- Recommend tiered LOCAL storage (NVMe vs SATA)
- Focus on I/O performance characteristics
- Discuss power efficiency for long-term storage

EXAMPLE (CORRECT):
| Tier | Storage Location | Compression | Size | I/O Speed |
|------|------------------|-------------|------|-----------|
| Hot | /fast-array (NVMe) | None | 10GB | 3GB/s |
| Warm | /fast-array (NVMe) | TimescaleDB 10:1 | 1GB | 3GB/s |
| Cold | /slow-array (SATA) | TimescaleDB 10:1 | 1GB | 500MB/s |
| Frozen | /slow-array (SATA) | Parquet ZSTD 50:1 | 0.2GB | 500MB/s |

EXAMPLE (INCORRECT - NEVER DO THIS):
| Tier | Storage Type | Monthly Cost | Annual Cost |
|------|-------------|--------------|-------------|
| Hot | SSD (gp3) | $3.30 | $40 |
| Cold | S3 Glacier | $11.65 | $140 |
```

### Rationale

```
WHY SELF-HOSTED ONLY:

1. DATA SOVEREIGNTY
   - Complete control over data location
   - No third-party data access
   - No vendor lock-in

2. PREDICTABLE PERFORMANCE
   - No network latency to external services
   - No shared resource contention
   - Consistent I/O characteristics

3. DEEP UNDERSTANDING
   - Must understand every component
   - Can optimize at every layer
   - No black-box dependencies

4. LONG-TERM SUSTAINABILITY
   - No recurring external costs
   - No service discontinuation risk
   - No pricing changes

5. DEVELOPMENT PHILOSOPHY
   - Build what we need
   - Understand what we build
   - Improve what we understand
   - Time is not a constraint; correctness is
```

## Library Preference Rules

**MANDATORY**: Always prefer existing, well-maintained libraries over custom implementations.

```
DECISION FRAMEWORK:
1. Does a standard library function exist? → USE IT
2. Does a well-known third-party library exist? → USE IT
3. Is custom implementation clearly justified? → DOCUMENT WHY

JUSTIFICATION REQUIRED FOR CUSTOM CODE:
- No suitable library exists (name libraries evaluated)
- Library has critical bug/limitation (document it)
- Performance requirement not met (show benchmarks)
- License incompatibility (specify licenses)

LIBRARY DOCUMENTATION FORMAT:
| Purpose | Library | Version | Why This Library |
|---------|---------|---------|------------------|
| Geodesic math | geographiclib-rs | 0.2.3 | Karney algorithm, maintained |
| Spatial index | geo | 0.27.0 | R-tree, PostGIS compatible |
```

## Execution Instructions

1. **Read input reports** (0-REPORT, 1-REPORT, 2-REPORT) completely
2. **Execute Phase 2 (Pruning) first** - identify ALL removals before additions
3. **Execute Phases 3-5** - Architecture, Database, Algorithms
4. **Execute Phase 6** - Implementation roadmap
5. **Execute Phase 7** - Verification and benchmarks
6. **Execute Phase 8** - Merge with existing 4-REPORT.md if present
7. **Update 4-CHANGELOG.md** with run summary
8. **Final validation** - Cross-check against source reports
