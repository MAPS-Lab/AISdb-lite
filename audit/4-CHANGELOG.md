## [Run 2025-12-11 19:15] - Report Version 4.1.0

### Summary
Critical correction to storage strategy based on actual workload requirements: 10+ years of historical AIS data for ML training. Traditional "Hot/Warm/Cold" tiering is inappropriate when historical data IS the primary workload. Updated to keep ALL data on /fast-array with /slow-array reserved for backups only.

### Changes

#### [UPDATED] Section 11.4: Storage Strategy for Historical Research Workloads
- **CRITICAL CHANGE**: Replaced traditional tiered storage (Hot→Warm→Cold→Frozen) with research-optimized architecture
- ALL historical data stays on /fast-array (NVMe) - no degradation to slower storage
- /slow-array used for BACKUPS ONLY, not active query serving
- Aggressive compression (24h delay instead of 7d) for storage efficiency
- Full indexes on ALL chunks (no BRIN-only degradation for "cold" data)
- NO retention policy - historical data is the PRIMARY asset
- Added hardware sizing table for 10+ years at various scales

#### [UPDATED] Section 13.3: Storage Array Allocation
- Restructured diagram to show research-optimized architecture
- Removed "move_chunk() after 30 days" - no data movement to slow storage
- /slow-array purpose clarified: backups and optional Parquet exports only
- Added explanation of why tiered storage is WRONG for ML training workloads

#### [ADDED] Rationale
- ML training requires full dataset scans across ALL years
- Historical data accessed as frequently as recent data
- Age-based storage degradation penalizes 90%+ of the data
- 10x slower queries on historical data is unacceptable for research

### Statistics
- Sections Updated: 2 (11.4, 13.3)
- Lines Changed: ~150
- Total Report Size: ~4,130 lines

1. **Spatial accuracy**: GEOGRAPHY type for geodesic calculations
2. **Time-series optimization**: Hypertables with proper chunking
3. **Query performance**: Combined spatial-temporal indexing
4. **Storage efficiency**: Compression + tiered tablespaces
5. **Self-hosted**: Uses local /fast-array and /slow-array

---

## [Prompt Update 2025-12-11] - Prompt Version 1.1.0

### Summary
Updated 4-PROMPT.md to enforce self-hosted infrastructure philosophy. All future report generations will prohibit external/cloud service recommendations.

### Changes to 4-PROMPT.md

#### [ADDED] Self-Hosted Infrastructure Philosophy Section
New mandatory constraints added:

**Prohibited External Dependencies:**
- Cloud storage services (AWS S3, Glacier, Azure Blob, GCP Storage)
- Managed database services (RDS, Aurora, TimescaleDB Cloud)
- SaaS/PaaS solutions with recurring costs
- External APIs with per-request billing
- Resource-for-hire models (cloud compute, serverless)

**Required Self-Hosted Alternatives:**
- Local NVMe RAID for hot data (/fast-array)
- Local SATA RAID for cold/archive data (/slow-array)
- PostgreSQL tablespaces for tiered storage
- Local Parquet files with ZSTD compression
- DuckDB for analytical queries on archives

**Cost Analysis Requirements:**
- Never reference cloud pricing ($/GB/month)
- Focus on compression ratios and storage efficiency
- Recommend tiered LOCAL storage (NVMe vs SATA)
- Discuss I/O performance characteristics

#### [UPDATED] Deployment Target Constraints
- Updated storage assumption: "Dual array (NVMe RAID for hot data, SATA RAID for cold/archive)"
- Updated OS: "Linux (Pop!_OS/Ubuntu-based)"

### Rationale
The development philosophy requires:
1. Complete data sovereignty
2. Deep understanding of every component
3. No external dependencies or recurring costs
4. Build, understand, and improve everything ourselves
5. Time is not a constraint; correctness and self-reliance are

### Impact on Future Reports
The next regeneration of 4-REPORT.md will:
- Remove AWS/cloud pricing references
- Replace S3/Glacier storage with local Parquet archives
- Use PostgreSQL tablespaces on /slow-array for cold tier
- Focus on storage efficiency rather than cloud costs
