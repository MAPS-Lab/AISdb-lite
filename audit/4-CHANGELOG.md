| Run Date | Report Version | Major Changes | Lines Changed |
|----------|---------------|---------------|---------------|
| 2025-12-11 | 3.1.0 (Initial) | Changelog created | N/A |

## [Prompt Update 2025-12-11] - Prompt Version 1.1.0

### Summary
Updated 4-PROMPT.md to enforce self-hosted infrastructure philosophy. All future report generations will prohibit external/cloud service recommendations.

### Changes to 4-PROMPT.md

#### [ADDED] Self-Hosted Infrastructure Philosophy Section
New mandatory constraints added:

**Prohibited External Dependencies:**
- Cloud storage services (AWS S3, Glacier, Azure Blob, GCP Storage)
- Managed database services (RDS, Aurora, TimescaleDB Cloud)
- SaaS/PaaS solutions with recurring costs
- External APIs with per-request billing
- Resource-for-hire models (cloud compute, serverless)

**Required Self-Hosted Alternatives:**
- Local NVMe RAID for hot data (/fast-array)
- Local SATA RAID for cold/archive data (/slow-array)
- PostgreSQL tablespaces for tiered storage
- Local Parquet files with ZSTD compression
- DuckDB for analytical queries on archives

**Cost Analysis Requirements:**
- Never reference cloud pricing ($/GB/month)
- Focus on compression ratios and storage efficiency
- Recommend tiered LOCAL storage (NVMe vs SATA)
- Discuss I/O performance characteristics

#### [UPDATED] Deployment Target Constraints
- Updated storage assumption: "Dual array (NVMe RAID for hot data, SATA RAID for cold/archive)"
- Updated OS: "Linux (Pop!_OS/Ubuntu-based)"

### Rationale
The development philosophy requires:
1. Complete data sovereignty
2. Deep understanding of every component
3. No external dependencies or recurring costs
4. Build, understand, and improve everything ourselves
5. Time is not a constraint; correctness and self-reliance are

### Impact on Future Reports
The next regeneration of 4-REPORT.md will:
- Remove AWS/cloud pricing references
- Replace S3/Glacier storage with local Parquet archives
- Use PostgreSQL tablespaces on /slow-array for cold tier
- Focus on storage efficiency rather than cloud costs
