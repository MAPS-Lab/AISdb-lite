## [Run 2025-12-11 Initial] - Version 1.8.0-alpha

### Summary
Initial changelog creation. The existing 0-REPORT.md was created through multiple analysis runs that identified and corrected numerous documentation errors. This changelog will track all future changes.

### Historical Corrections (Pre-Changelog)

The following corrections were made in previous analysis sessions before this changelog was established:

#### Section 5: Rust Crate Architecture
- [CORRECTION] ReceiverArgs struct: Field names like `db_path`, `source`, `tls_cert`, `tls_key` were documented but DO NOT EXIST. Actual fields: `udp_listen_addr`, `tcp_listen_addr`, `tcp_connect_addr`, `multicast_addr_rawdata`, `multicast_addr_parsed`, etc.
- [CORRECTION] VesselData struct: Simplified to only contain `payload: Option<ParsedMessage>` and `epoch: Option<i32>`. Previous documentation incorrectly listed many individual fields.

#### Section 6: Python Package Structure
- [CORRECTION] TrackGen: Documented as class but is actually a generator FUNCTION
- [CORRECTION] `interp_heading()` and `interp_utm()`: Documented but DO NOT EXIST. Only 4 interpolation methods exist.
- [CORRECTION] Gebco class: `get_depth()` and `get_depths()` methods DO NOT EXIST. Only `merge_tracks()` is implemented.
- [CORRECTION] ShoreDist.get_distance(): Signature is `get_distance(tracks)` not `get_distance(lon, lat)`
- [CORRECTION] FileChecksums: Uses MD5, not SHA256 as previously documented
- [CORRECTION] `marinetraffic_metadict()`: Function DOES NOT EXIST

#### Section 7: SQL Database Schema
- [BUG DOCUMENTED] insert_webdata_marinetraffic.sql line 24: `summer_dwt = excluded.gross_tonnage` should be `summer_dwt = excluded.summer_dwt`
- [BUG DOCUMENTED] select_join_dynamic_static_clusteredidx.sql: Contains duplicate utc_second column

#### Section 10: Testing Architecture
- [CORRECTION] test_004_sqlfcn.py and test_005_dbqry.py: Previously documented as "SQLite tests" but ALL tests are PostgreSQL-only. These are for different PostgreSQL configurations (monthly tables vs global hypertables).

### Agents Used (Historical)
The report was created using 10 specialized exploration agents with cross-report contradiction analysis.
