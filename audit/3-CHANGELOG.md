## [Run 2025-12-12 Fresh Analysis v5] - Report Version 1.5.0

### Summary
Executed fresh unbiased analysis using 10 specialized agents. Discovered three new quantitative contradictions related to panic counts, Python file counts, and Rust file counts.

## Future Analysis Recommendations

### High Priority Checks
1. **CRITICAL**: Apply TRACK-002 correction to 1-REPORT.md (haversine is a real bug)
2. After any code changes, verify line numbers in 1-REPORT.md
3. When bugs are fixed, update 1-REPORT.md status and 3-REPORT.md cross-references
4. When new modules added, update 0-REPORT.md and verify consistency

### Automation Opportunities
1. Script to verify file paths mentioned in reports exist
2. Script to verify function names mentioned in reports exist
3. Script to compare line numbers in reports to actual code
4. **NEW**: Script to verify haversine call sites for parameter order
