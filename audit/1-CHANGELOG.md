## [Run 2025-12-11 Cross-Report Analysis] - Report Version 1.2.0

### Summary
Cross-report contradiction analysis (3-REPORT v1.1.0) identified that TRACK-002 was incorrectly marked as FALSE POSITIVE. Fresh source code analysis confirmed the haversine coordinate order bug IS REAL and must be reinstated.

### Regressions Corrected
- [REINSTATED] TRACK-002: Haversine Coordinate Swap in Distance Calculation (HIGH)
  - **Previous Status**: FALSE POSITIVE
  - **New Status**: REAL BUG (HIGH severity)
  - **Evidence**: Rust function `haversine(x1, y1, x2, y2)` expects x=longitude, y=latitude (per docstring in src/lib.rs lines 30-38), but Python code passes (lat, lon, lat, lon)
  - **Reference**: 3-REPORT CONTRA-ST-002

### Changes Applied
1. Header CORRECTION NOTE updated to show TRACK-002 reinstated
2. TRACK-002 section rewritten from FALSE POSITIVE to REAL BUG with full evidence
3. Priority Recommendations updated to include TRACK-002
4. False positive count reduced from 5 to 4
5. Total bug count adjusted (113 base + 58 new = 171)

### Statistics After Correction
- **Total Bugs**: 171 (was 170)
- **False Positives Removed**: 4 (was 5)
- **False Positive Reinstated**: TRACK-002

### Git State
- Branch: audit
- Last Commit: f1c610e - Fix the pipeline
- Uncommitted Changes: Yes

## [Run 2025-12-11 Initial] - Report Version 1.0.0

### Summary
Initial changelog creation. The existing 1-REPORT.md was created through comprehensive analysis by 10 specialized exploration agents. This changelog will track all future changes.

### Initial Bug Analysis Statistics
- **Total Bugs Found**: 112 (reduced from 117 after cross-report verification)
- **Critical Bugs**: 30
- **High Severity**: 39
- **Medium Severity**: 35
- **Low Severity**: 8

### Historical Corrections (Pre-Changelog)

The following corrections were made during the initial analysis before this changelog was established:

#### False Positives Identified and Removed

| Bug ID | Original Issue | Reason for Removal |
|--------|----------------|-------------------|
| PYDB-003 | Off-by-one error in query loop | Final `yield mmsi_rows` returns all remaining data - intentional design |
| SQL-004 | Missing table alias 'ref' in global query | `ref` alias references `coarsetype_ref` via CTE - valid SQL template |
| SQL-005 | Missing table alias in regional query | Same as SQL-004 - valid SQL template pattern |
| ~~TRACK-002~~ | ~~Coordinate swap in haversine distance~~ | ~~Rust haversine expects (lat, lon) order - code is CORRECT~~ **REINSTATED v1.2.0 - WAS INCORRECT** |
| DISC-002 | Missing return statement in get_resolution_for_area() | Function DOES NOT EXIST in actual codebase |

#### Bug Distribution by Component (Initial)

| Component | Critical | High | Medium | Low | Total |
|-----------|----------|------|--------|-----|-------|
| Rust Crates | 2 | 9 | 2 | 0 | 13 |
| Python Database Layer | 2 | 7 | 4 | 1 | 14 |
| SQL Files | 3 | 2 | 3 | 0 | 8 |
| Track Processing (Python) | 1 | 6 | 5 | 0 | 12 |
| Web Frontend (JS/TS) | 4 | 5 | 3 | 1 | 13 |
| Webdata/Weather (Python) | 3 | 5 | 2 | 1 | 11 |
| Tests | 2 | 7 | 4 | 0 | 13 |
| Build Configuration | 3 | 5 | 3 | 1 | 12 |
| Cross-Cutting Integration | 2 | 3 | 2 | 0 | 7 |
| Discretize/Misc | 2 | 4 | 3 | 2 | 11 |

#### Correction Note Added to Report
Added prominent correction note at top of report documenting:
- SQL-004, SQL-005: `ref` table alias is valid (references `coarsetype_ref` table)
- ~~TRACK-002: Haversine coordinate order is correct~~ **REINSTATED v1.2.0** - Fresh analysis found this WAS a real bug
- DISC-002: Referenced function does not exist
- INT-001: PostgreSQL uses INTEGER (32-bit), not BIGINT (64-bit)
